<b>OVERVIEW </b>
<br><br>
MASH project a non-profit youth led organisation is organising an 8 hour intensive workshop on the 'Internet of Things'. Internet Of Things, in layman terms, is the network of objects with embedded electronics to facilitate the exchange and collection of data. With more devices having WiFi capabilities now, probably LiFi capabilities in the future and having sensors built into them, the technology costs have, and will go down, thus, creating perfect headwinds for the Internet of Things.<br>
We wish to disseminate relevant skills and provide hands-on experience. For further details read on.
